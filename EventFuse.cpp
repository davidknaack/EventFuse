/*
 * EventFuse.cpp - A simple fuse-based event callback library
 * v0.1 - 2009-June-16
 * v0.2 - 2009-June-16 Added fsBlocked state to handle callback reentrance.
 * v0.3 - 2012-April-27
 *   - Minor update to burn() to out or range issue in repeatCount.
 *     This caused problems with INF_REPEAT fuses.
 * v0.4 - 2013-Dec-20
 *   - Converted to namespace.
 *   - added burn() to burn by one.
 *   - changed callback user data to int&
 *   - added cancel(FuseID) 
 * Derived from:
 * Timer.cpp - A Real-time Timer Library for Arduino & Wiring
